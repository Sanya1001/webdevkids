            <div class="content">
                One of my favorite features of CSS is the
                <span class="highlight">flexbox</span> . Whenever it is possible,
                I always use flexbox to position my elements. It is very easy to use and 
                inherently responsive. It reduces the need to write viewport specific designs.
                In general, I find it easy to manipulate, especially when I have multiple elements
                I want to control. In fact, I have found using a flexbox even solves my problems 
                of centering elements!

        <div id="part2" class="body">
            <div class="title">Hidden Divs</div>
            <div class="content">
                Magic is all about <span class="highlight">illusions</span> and hiding things, and 
                this is no different in web development! Want to show something only when the user 
                clicks on a button? Use a hidden div! <br>
                The idea is to create multiple overlapping divs, and then use JavaScript to hide and
                show them when needed. Create everything you need, two versions of the same thing,
                right on top of each other. Then, use JavaScript to hide one of them. My favorite
                way to do this is using an <span class="highlight">active</span> class which I 
                toggle as needed. When the active class is there, the div is visible, and when it is 
                not, by default it is hidden, that is, its <span class="highlight">display</span> is 
                none. <br>
                This is also very useful in animation, along with a related property,
                <span class="highlight">overflow</span> . 
            </div>
        </div>
        <div id="part3" class="body">
            <div class="title">Z-index</div>
            <div class="content">
                Another useful property is <span class="highlight">z-index</span> . This is used to
                control the order in which elements are displayed- somewhat similar to layers, if 
                you are familiar with some form of digital art software. Contrary to hidden divs,
                this is useful when you want to display all of your overlapping elements. <br>
                I use this a lot when I want to create a
                <span class="highlight">moving background</span> effect! I have a 
                video play on loop and place it behind my main content, using a lower z-index 
                than the main content.

        <div class="title">Bootstrap</div>
        <div class="content">
            Don't want to write all of your CSS from scratch or don't know how to do it yet?
            <span class="highlight">Bootstrap</span> got you covered! Bootstrap is a frontend toolkit 
            that makes it easy to implement several useful features and website components. 
            It provides a range of prebuilt functionality, such as buttons, forms, and navigation bars.
            It is also <span class="highlight">responsive</span> !
            I used to use Bootstrap a lot when I was just learning a lot of webdev. 
            I still use it when I am building websites that might be maintained by someone else, for the sake of 
            readibility and ease of use, or when I am unsure of the responsiveness of a design. <br>
            All you need to do is include the starter CSS and JS files, and you are good to use 
            any of their other components. Check out the
