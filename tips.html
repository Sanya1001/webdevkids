            <div class="content">
                One of my favorite features of CSS is the
                <span class="highlight">flexbox</span> . Whenever it is possible,
                I always use flexbox to position my elements. It is very easy to use and 
                inherently responsive. It reduces the need to write viewport specific designs.
                In general, I find it easy to manipulate, especially when I have multiple elements
                I want to control. In fact, I have found using a flexbox even solves my problems 
                of centering elements!

        <div id="part2" class="body">
            <div class="title">Hidden Divs</div>
            <div class="content">
                Magic is all about <span class="highlight">illusions</span> and hiding things, and 
                this is no different in web development! Want to show something only when the user 
                clicks on a button? Use a hidden div! <br>
                The idea is to create multiple overlapping divs, and then use JavaScript to hide and
                show them when needed. Create everything you need, two versions of the same thing,
                right on top of each other. Then, use JavaScript to hide one of them. My favorite
                way to do this is using an <span class="highlight">active</span> class which I 
                toggle as needed. When the active class is there, the div is visible, and when it is 
                not, by default it is hidden, that is, its <span class="highlight">display</span> is 
                none. <br>
                This is also very useful in animation, along with a related property,
                <span class="highlight">overflow</span> . 
            </div>
        </div>
        <div id="part3" class="body">
            <div class="title">Z-index</div>
            <div class="content">
                Another useful property is <span class="highlight">z-index</span> . This is used to
                control the order in which elements are displayed- somewhat similar to layers, if 
                you are familiar with some form of digital art software. Contrary to hidden divs,
                this is useful when you want to display all of your overlapping elements. <br>
                I use this a lot when I want to create a
                <span class="highlight">moving background</span> effect! I have a 
                video play on loop and place it behind my main content, using a lower z-index 
                than the main content.

        <div class="title">Bootstrap</div>
        <div class="content">
            Don't want to write all of your CSS from scratch or don't know how to do it yet?
            <span class="highlight">Bootstrap</span> got you covered! Bootstrap is a frontend toolkit 
            that makes it easy to implement several useful features and website components. 
            It provides a range of prebuilt functionality, such as buttons, forms, and navigation bars.
            It is also <span class="highlight">responsive</span> !
            I used to use Bootstrap a lot when I was just learning a lot of webdev. 
            I still use it when I am building websites that might be maintained by someone else, for the sake of 
            readibility and ease of use, or when I am unsure of the responsiveness of a design. <br>
            All you need to do is include the starter CSS and JS files, and you are good to use 
            any of their other components. Check out the

            Hi my SGWC friends! This section is for you! <br>
            Read some of these tips to get started with CSS, and look these up on the internet 
            if you want a better understanding. Which of these can you find these on CodeHS docs? ;)
            <br>
            I will be adding more tips as I think of them, so remember to check back sometimes.
            I will also be adding some challenges for you to try out as you read these tips.
            I promise they will be up soon!!

            <span class="beginner">&gt; Absolute Positioning</span> <br><br>
            Absolute positioning is a way to position elements relative to the viewport. 
            This is useful when you want to position an element in a specific place, 
            regardless of the size of the viewport, or when you have scrolled. <br>
            To use absolute positioning, you need to set the position of the element to 
            <span class="highlight">absolute</span> . Then, you can use the 
            <span class="highlight">top</span> , <span class="highlight">bottom</span> , 
            <span class="highlight">left</span> , and <span class="highlight">right</span> properties
            to position the element.
            <br><br>
            <span class="beginner"> &gt; Background Gradient</span> <br><br>
            Using a gradient as a background is a great way to offer some change from the common
            solid color background. I use 
            <a href="http://cssgradient.io/" class="link">CSS Gradient</a> to generate 
            my gradients. <br>
            After you select your colors for your <span class="highlight">gradient</span>
            , you can copy the CSS code and 
            paste it in your file. Very easy! <br>
            Looking at the code, can you tell how to 
            <span class="highlight">write your own gradient</span> ? <br><br>
            <span class="beginner"> &gt; Background Image</span> <br><br>
            As I already said, backgrounds are important! What if you want your title to be 
            displayed over a cool image? The <span class="highlight">background-image</span> 
            property is what you are probably looking for! <br>
            Find your favorite image and 
            <span class="highlight">copy the URL</span> from right clicking the image 
            (if you are using a local image, you can  use the path to the image). 
            Then, use the background-image property to set the image as the 
            background by putting the link in
            <span class="highlight">url("link-here")</span> . <br>
            background-image: url("https://www.example.com/image.jpg"); <br><br>
            <span class="beginner" id="hoverr"> &gt; Hover</span> <br><br>
            A CSS classic that you can find on almost every website- the text for links
            change color when you hover over them! <br>
            Write your CSS selector for the element you want to change as usual
            (class/tag/id), and then add the <span class="highlight">":hover" pseudo-class</span> . 
            Then, write the CSS properties you want to change when the user hovers over the 
            element, which is usually color. <br> For example, if I want to change the color of
            all links to red when the user hovers over them, I would write: <br>
            a:hover { <br>
                color: red; <br>
            } <br>
            Exactly like 
            <a href="#hoverr" id="eglink" class="link">this link that does nothing</a>. <br> <br>
            (<span class="highlight">Challenge</span>:
            Can you make a link that does nothing? What do you think changed when you clicked on
            the link? Hint: Look at the URL before and after) <br>
            <span class="highlight">Note</span>: This feature does not work on mobile devices!
            <br><br>
            <span class="beginner"> &gt; Text Decoration</span> <br><br>
            Text decoration is a way to add some flair to your text. You can use it to add
            <span class="highlight">underline</span> , <span class="highlight">overline</span> ,
            or <span class="highlight">line-through</span>, and other styles to your text.
            This is actually a
            <span class="highlight">shorthand property</span> for text-decoration-line, 
            text-decoration-color, text-decoration-style, text-decoration-thickness. 
            You can use a combination of the following options: <br>
            underline, overline, line-through (Type of line)<br>
            solid, double, dotted, wavy, dashed (Style of line) <br>
            You can also add the color and thickness you want the line to be. <br>
            For example, if I want a thick dashed underline to my text in red, I would write: <br>
            text-decoration: underline dashed red 5px; <br>
            <span id="tdeg">Like this line!</span>
