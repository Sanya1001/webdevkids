            <div class="content">
                One of my favorite features of CSS is the
                <span class="highlight">flexbox</span> . Whenever it is possible,
                I always use flexbox to position my elements. It is very easy to use and 
                inherently responsive. It reduces the need to write viewport specific designs.
                In general, I find it easy to manipulate, especially when I have multiple elements
                I want to control. In fact, I have found using a flexbox even solves my problems 
                of centering elements!

        <div id="part2" class="body">
            <div class="title">Hidden Divs</div>
            <div class="content">
                Magic is all about <span class="highlight">illusions</span> and hiding things, and 
                this is no different in web development! Want to show something only when the user 
                clicks on a button? Use a hidden div! <br>
                The idea is to create multiple overlapping divs, and then use JavaScript to hide and
                show them when needed. Create everything you need, two versions of the same thing,
                right on top of each other. Then, use JavaScript to hide one of them. My favorite
                way to do this is using an <span class="highlight">active</span> class which I 
                toggle as needed. When the active class is there, the div is visible, and when it is 
                not, by default it is hidden, that is, its <span class="highlight">display</span> is 
                none. <br>
                This is also very useful in animation, along with a related property,
                <span class="highlight">overflow</span> . 
            </div>
        </div>
        <div id="part3" class="body">
            <div class="title">Z-index</div>
            <div class="content">
                Another useful property is <span class="highlight">z-index</span> . This is used to
                control the order in which elements are displayed- somewhat similar to layers, if 
                you are familiar with some form of digital art software. Contrary to hidden divs,
                this is useful when you want to display all of your overlapping elements. <br>
                I use this a lot when I want to create a
                <span class="highlight">moving background</span> effect! I have a 
                video play on loop and place it behind my main content, using a lower z-index 
                than the main content.

        <div class="title">Bootstrap</div>
        <div class="content">
            Don't want to write all of your CSS from scratch or don't know how to do it yet?
            <span class="highlight">Bootstrap</span> got you covered! Bootstrap is a frontend toolkit 
            that makes it easy to implement several useful features and website components. 
            It provides a range of prebuilt functionality, such as buttons, forms, and navigation bars.
            It is also <span class="highlight">responsive</span> !
            I used to use Bootstrap a lot when I was just learning a lot of webdev. 
            I still use it when I am building websites that might be maintained by someone else, for the sake of 
            readibility and ease of use, or when I am unsure of the responsiveness of a design. <br>
            All you need to do is include the starter CSS and JS files, and you are good to use 
            any of their other components. Check out the

        <span class="beginner">(beginner)</span>

            <br> <br>
            <span class="beginner">&gt; Absolute Positioning</span> <br><br>
            Absolute positioning is a way to position elements relative to the viewport. 
            This is useful when you want to position an element in a specific place, 
            regardless of the size of the viewport, or when you have scrolled. <br>
            To use absolute positioning, you need to set the position of the element to 
            <span class="highlight">absolute</span> . Then, you can use the 
            <span class="highlight">top</span> , <span class="highlight">bottom</span> , 
            <span class="highlight">left</span> , and <span class="highlight">right</span> properties
            to position the element.
            <br><br>
            <span class="beginner"> &gt; Background Gradient</span> <br><br>
            Using a gradient as a background is a great way to offer some change from the common
            solid color background. I use 
            <a href="http://cssgradient.io/" class="link">CSS Gradient</a> to generate 
            my gradients. <br>
            After you select your colors for your <span class="highlight">gradient</span>
            , you can copy the CSS code and 
            paste it in your file. Very easy! <br>
            Looking at the code, can you tell how to 
            <span class="highlight">write your own gradient</span> ? <br><br>
            <span class="beginner"> &gt; Background Image</span> <br><br>
            As I already said, backgrounds are important! What if you want your title to be 
            displayed over a cool image? The <span class="highlight">background-image</span> 
            property is what you are probably looking for! <br>
            Find your favorite image and 
            <span class="highlight">copy the URL</span> from right clicking the image 
            (if you are using a local image, you can  use the path to the image). 
            Then, use the background-image property to set the image as the 
            background by putting the link in
            <span class="highlight">url("link-here")</span> . <br>
            background-image: url("https://www.example.com/image.jpg"); <br><br>
            <span class="beginner" id="hoverr"> &gt; Hover</span> <br><br>
            A CSS classic that you can find on almost every website- the text for links
            change color when you hover over them! <br>
            Write your CSS selector for the element you want to change as usual
            (class/tag/id), and then add the <span class="highlight">":hover" pseudo-class</span> . 
            Then, write the CSS properties you want to change when the user hovers over the 
            element, which is usually color. <br> For example, if I want to change the color of
            all links to red when the user hovers over them, I would write: <br>
            a:hover { <br>
                color: red; <br>
            } <br>
            Exactly like 
            <a href="#hoverr" id="eglink" class="link">this link that does nothing</a>. <br> <br>
            <span class="highlight">Challenge</span>:
            Can you make a link that does nothing? What do you think changed when you clicked on
            the link? Hint: Look at the URL before and after <br> <br>
            <span class="highlight">Note</span>: This feature does not work on mobile devices!
            <br><br>
            <span class="beginner"> &gt; Text Decoration</span> <br><br>
            Text decoration is a way to add some flair to your text. You can use it to add
            <span class="highlight">underline</span> , <span class="highlight">overline</span> ,
            or <span class="highlight">line-through</span>, and other styles to your text.
            This is actually a
            <span class="highlight">shorthand property</span> for text-decoration-line, 
            text-decoration-color, text-decoration-style, text-decoration-thickness. 
            You can use a combination of the following options: <br>
            underline, overline, line-through (Type of line)<br>
            solid, double, dotted, wavy, dashed (Style of line) <br>
            You can also add the color and thickness you want the line to be. <br>
            For example, if I want a thick dashed underline to my text in red, I would write: <br>
            text-decoration: underline dashed red 5px; <br>
            <span id="tdeg">Like this line!</span>
            <br><br>
            <span class="beginner"> &gt; Border Radius</span> <br><br>
            Border radius is a way to make the <span class="highlight">rounded corners</span>  
            for your element. As a person who loves soft features on my websites, 
            I use this a lot. <br>
            You can use the <span class="highlight">border-radius</span> property to set the
            radius of the corners. You can set the radius of each corner individually, or you
            can set the radius for all corners at once. <br>
            For example, if I wanted to make the corners of my element rounded, I would write: <br>
            border-radius: 10px; <br> <br>
            <span id="breg">Like this element!</span>
            <br><br>
            <span class="highlight">Challenge</span>:
            Obviously in the above example, I also changed the color, background-color, and 
            padding of the element. Can you figure out how to do that? <br> <br>
            <span class="highlight">Challenge</span>: Can you change the border radius of an
            element to make it into a circle? Hint: You need to fix/know the 
            height and width of the element. <br> <br>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="part6" class="body">
        <div class="title">Interesting HTML Basics</div>
        <span class="beginner">(beginner)</span>
        <div class="content">
            <br><br>
            <span class="beginner"> &gt; Video tag</span> <br><br>
            This is by far my favorite basic HTML tag that you can pretty much manipulate
            without the help of CSS. The <span class="highlight">video</span> tag lets you add 
            a video to your page. You can add a video from a URL, or you can add a video from
            your computer. My absolute favorite way to use it is to create the
            <span class="highlight">"moving background"</span>  effect in conjunction with the 
            <a href="#part3" class="link">Z-index</a>. <br>
            Use the video tag and add your URL/ relative file path to the 
            <span class="highlight">src</span> attribute. You can also add 
            the <span class="highlight">autoplay</span> attribute to make the video play 
            automatically. To make it play infinitely add 
            <span class="highlight">loop</span> attribute. 
            (Some browsers don't work well with videos that have audio; add the 
            <span class="highlight">muted</span> attribute to avoid this problem!)<br>
            <br>
            Example: <br>
            &lt;video src="https://www.example.com/video.mp4" autoplay loop muted>&lt;/video> <br><br>
            <span class="highlight">Note</span>: Try writing out the line above as plain text in your 
            HTML instead of as code (just like I did!). What problems do you see? 
            How can we include text that look like HTML tags as plain text? <br><br>
            <span class="beginner"> &gt; Button</span> <br><br>
            Buttons are everywhere! They are used to submit forms, to link to other pages, or 
            maybe activate some feature. The <span class="highlight">button</span> tag is used to 
            create a button. For example,
            &lt;button>Click me!&lt;/button> <br>
            You can also add the <span class="highlight">type</span> attribute to specify the type 
            of button it is (button, reset, submit). This is an easy way to add some interactivness 
            to your website without knowing JavaScript. Try out the following in CodeHS: <br>
            &lt;button type="button" onclick="alert('Hi!')">Click me!&lt;/button> <br> <br>
            <span class="highlight">Note</span>: The 
            <span class="highlight">onclick</span> attribute is a JavaScript attribute. In reality,
            with <span class="highlight">JavaScript</span>, you can make just about any element a button,
            even without using the button tag! <br><br>
