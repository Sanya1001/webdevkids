            <div class="content">
                Have you ever noticed a website look different on your laptop and on your phone?
                Different devices have different widths or viewports; which means that our designs
                might not look cool on every device. (Check out the welcome page of this website on 
                your phones to see what I mean!) <br>
                But we are designers and we are smart- we can make our designs adjustable to different 
                devices, also called <span class="highlight">'responsive design'</span>.
                <br>
                How can you make your design responsive? <br>
                My #1 tip is to always use a <span class="highlight">flex display</span>. Flex boxes are usually 
                already responsive and do the work for you. <br>
                Another general tip is to use the dev tools from Chrome. Right click and use the 
                <span class="highlight">inspect</span> option. You can then change the width of the viewport 
                and see how your webpage looks on different devices. <br>
                The advanced trick is to make completely
                <span class="highlight">different designs for different viewports</span> using @media query.

                Here's your challenge: <br><br>
                <span class="challenge">
                    Show items in a row on wider screens and in a column on smaller screens.

            <div class="content">
                You are learning to make all these amazing websites, but what would be more amazing is 
                if you could show them to your friends and family from the internet. And thanks to 
                GitHub, you can! There are several paid hosting platforms that allow us to publish or
                'host' our websites, but GitHub (with some constraints) lets us do this for free.
                GitHub is an important tool for all developers and 
                <span class="hightlight">GitHub Pages</span> is just one of its many features. Its 
                constraints are that it is a static hosting service, but that's not a problem for us. 
                <br> 
                Visit <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> to get started by making an account.
                Then create a new repository and name it <span class="highlight">username.github.io</span>.
                Then upload your related files to the repository. Remember to name your main html file as 
                index.html.

                Here's your challenge: <br><br>
                <span class="challenge">
                    Host your website on GitHub Pages.

        <div id="part3" class="body">

            <div id = "content3" class="content">
                This is an all time favorite of this generation. In execution,
                <span class="highlight">Dark Mode</span> or pretty much any theme is very simple! 
                All you need to do is to change the colors of your website upon the click of a button. 
                Which means, we essentially have two tasks: <br>
                1. Create a button (HTML) and track its click event (JS). <br>
                2. Change the colors of the website (CSS/JS). <br>
                My favorite way to do this is using classes. I create a 'dark' class, which I add and 
                remove alternately, or <span class="highlight">toggle</span> 
                everytime the button is clicked (which is very easy thanks to JS). In other words, my
                containers have a default color selection, which is changed to a dark color when the 
                dark class is added. You can also use JS to change the colors of the website. <br>
                <button id="themechange">Try Me</button>
